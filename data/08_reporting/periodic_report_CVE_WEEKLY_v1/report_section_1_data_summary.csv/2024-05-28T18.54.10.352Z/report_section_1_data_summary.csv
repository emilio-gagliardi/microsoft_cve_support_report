Base score metrics 
(8) 
Attack Vector 
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component. 
Network 
The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers). 
Attack Complexity 
This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration. 
Low 
Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component. 
Privileges Required 
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability. 
Low 
The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources. 
User Interaction 
This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner. 
None 
The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user. 
Scope 
Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component. 
Unchanged 
An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority. 
Confidentiality 
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones. 
High 
There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. 
Integrity 
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. 
High 
There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component. 
Availability 
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component. 
High 
There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable). 
 
 
Temporal score metrics 
(3) 
Exploit Code Maturity 
This metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked, and is typically based on the current state of exploit techniques, exploit code availability, or active, 'in-the-wild' exploitation. 
Unproven 
No exploit code is available, or an exploit is theoretical. 
Remediation Level 
The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final. 
Official Fix 
A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. 
Report Confidence 
This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers. 
Confirmed 
Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability. 
Please see  
Common Vulnerability Scoring System 
 for more information on the definition of these metrics.

post_type: Information only
","
Use the provided Microsoft Security Response Center post details below, generate a valid JSON object with a detailed and comprehensive summary. The summary should be less than 15 sentences long, explaining the nature of the vulnerability, how an attacker may exploit it, the underlying cause, and the availability of an official fix. The post is classified as one of ['Critical', 'New feature', 'Solution provided', 'Information only']. 
Use the post_type to guide your summary. If a post_type is 'Information only' it likely means Microsoft updated the FAQs but nothing substantive beyond the previous revision. So your summary is merely needs to state that the post is a updated revision and is information only. 

If a post_type is 'Solution provided' you must mention the remedy or workaround.
If a post_type is NaN, you can deduce the post_type by searching for 'Remediation Level' in the post body and whether it says 'Official Fix' or not.

Clearly identify the affected Microsoft product(s), services, and or features. Use your knowledge to add any related facts or comments for a better explanation. Do not restate the post title or use redundant metadata information. The metadata provided includes id, post_id, title, post_type, and published date.

Example summary:
Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) is affected by a use after free vulnerability in Profiles, identified as CVE-2023-5472. This vulnerability was assigned by Chrome and is addressed by ingesting Chromium. The latest version of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) is no longer vulnerable. The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the Chromium Open Source Software (OSS) consumed by Microsoft Edge. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Microsoft has provided a solution by releasing a security update for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) with the build number 118.0.2088.76. System administrators are advised to update their Microsoft Edge installations to the latest version to mitigate the risk of exploitation. For more information, refer to the [Google Chrome Releases](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023) page.

Generate a valid JSON object following this schema. DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER KEYS.

}

Notes for LLM:
- Ensure the summary is robust, technically thorough, and less than 15 sentences.
- Target audience is Microsoft system engineers and administrators - experts. Generate a summary that is informative and valuable for them. Basic information like how to find the browser version number is not useful.
- Focus on the key aspects of the vulnerability and its impact on the specific Microsoft:
    - which product(s) are affected
    - is a service affected? If so, which one?
    - is a specific feature affected?
    - what is the attack vector?
    - is there an official fix? If not, is there a temporary workaround?
- make sure you scan all sections looking for explicit workarounds, mitigations or powershell commands. These are the most valuable pieces of information for system administrators.
- Include relevant details from your training data to enhance the summary.
- Avoid redundancy with provided metadata. Do not re-state the title or post_type in your summary. The reader already has this information.
- Do not include FAQ information in your summary unless it specifically mentions additional technical details or links for further research.
What not to include in the summary guidelines:
- DO NOT generate any text like 'Microsoft acknowledges the efforts of ...'
- DO NOT generate any text like 'Users can check their browser version by clicking on the three dots (...) ...'.
- DO NOT include any special thanks or acknowledgements. Just report on actionable facts.
- The JSON object should be correctly formatted and include all required fields in the schema. Do not add any additional fields.
- Do not output any text outside of the json object because an external script will parse the output.

Base score metrics 
(8) 
Attack Vector 
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component. 
Network 
The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers). 
Attack Complexity 
This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration. 
Low 
Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component. 
Privileges Required 
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability. 
Low 
The attacker is authorized with (i.e., requires) privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges may have the ability to cause an impact only to non-sensitive resources. 
User Interaction 
This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner. 
None 
The vulnerable system can be exploited without any interaction from any user. 
Scope 
Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component. 
Unchanged 
An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority. 
Confidentiality 
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones. 
High 
There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. 
Integrity 
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. 
High 
There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component. 
Availability 
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component. 
High 
There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable). 
 
 
Temporal score metrics 
(3) 
Exploit Code Maturity 
This metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked, and is typically based on the current state of exploit techniques, exploit code availability, or active, 'in-the-wild' exploitation. 
Unproven 
No exploit code is available, or an exploit is theoretical. 
Remediation Level 
The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final. 
Official Fix 
A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. 
Report Confidence 
This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers. 
Confirmed 
Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability. 
Please see  
Common Vulnerability Scoring System 
 for more information on the definition of these metrics.

Base score metrics 
(8) 
Attack Vector 
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component. 
Network 
The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers). 
Attack Complexity 
This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration. 
Low 
Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. 
.
 An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component. 
Privileges Required 
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability. 
None 
The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack. 
User Interaction 
This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner. 
Required 
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. 
Scope 
Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component. 
Unchanged 
An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority. 
Confidentiality 
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones. 
High 
There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. 
Integrity 
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. 
High 
There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component. 
Availability 
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. 
.
 It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component. 
High 
There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable). 
 
 
Temporal score metrics 
(3) 
Exploit Code Maturity 
This metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked, and is typically based on the current state of exploit techniques, exploit code availability, or active, 'in-the-wild' exploitation. 
Unproven 
No exploit code is available, or an exploit is theoretical. 
Remediation Level 
The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final. 
Official Fix 
A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. 
Report Confidence 
This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. 
.
 The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers. 
Confirmed 
Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability. 
Please see  
Common Vulnerability Scoring System 
 for more information on the definition of these metrics. 
The following table provides an

Exploitation Less Likely 
According to the CVSS metric, the attack vector is network (AV:N) and the user interaction is required (UI:R). What is the target context of the remote code execution? 
This attack requires a client to connect to a malicious server, and that could allow the attacker to gain code execution on the client.

Use the provided Microsoft Security Response Center post details below, generate a valid JSON object with a detailed and comprehensive summary. The summary should be less than 15 sentences long, explaining the nature of the vulnerability, how an attacker may exploit it, the underlying cause, and the availability of an official fix. The post is classified as one of ['Critical', 'New feature', 'Solution provided', 'Information only']. 
Use the post_type to guide your summary. If a post_type is 'Information only' it likely means Microsoft updated the FAQs but nothing substantive beyond the previous revision. So your summary is merely needs to state that the post is a updated revision and is information only. 

If a post_type is 'Solution provided' you must mention the remedy or workaround.
If a post_type is NaN, you can deduce the post_type by searching for 'Remediation Level' in the post body and whether it says 'Official Fix' or not.

Clearly identify the affected Microsoft product(s), services, and or features. Use your knowledge to add any related facts or comments for a better explanation. Do not restate the post title or use redundant metadata information. The metadata provided includes id, post_id, title, post_type, and published date.

Example summary:
Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) is affected by a use after free vulnerability in Profiles, identified as CVE-2023-5472. This vulnerability was assigned by Chrome and is addressed by ingesting Chromium. The latest version of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) is no longer vulnerable. The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the Chromium Open Source Software (OSS) consumed by Microsoft Edge. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Microsoft has provided a solution by releasing a security update for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) with the build number 118.0.2088.76. System administrators are advised to update their Microsoft Edge installations to the latest version to mitigate the risk of exploitation. For more information, refer to the [Google Chrome Releases](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023) page.

Notes for LLM:
- Ensure the summary is robust, technically thorough, and less than 15 sentences.
- Target audience is Microsoft system engineers and administrators - experts. Generate a summary that is informative and valuable for them. Basic information like how to find the browser version number is not useful.
- Focus on the key aspects of the vulnerability and its impact on the specific Microsoft:
    - which product(s) are affected
    - is a service affected? If so, which one?
    - is a specific feature affected?
    - what is the attack vector?
    - is there an official fix? If not, is there a temporary workaround?
- make sure you scan all sections looking for explicit workarounds, mitigations or powershell commands. These are the most valuable pieces of information for system administrators.
- Include relevant details from your training data to enhance the summary.
- Avoid redundancy with provided metadata. Do not re-state the title or post_type in your summary. The reader already has this information.
- Do not include FAQ information in your summary unless it specifically mentions additional technical details or links for further research.
What not to include in the summary guidelines:
- DO NOT generate any text like 'Microsoft acknowledges the efforts of ...'
- DO NOT generate any text like 'Users can check their browser version by clicking on the three dots (...) ...'.
- DO NOT include any special thanks or acknowledgements. Just report on actionable facts.
- The JSON object should be correctly formatted and include all required fields in the schema. Do not add any additional fields.
- Do not output any text outside of the json object because an external script will parse the output.

Base score metrics 
(8) 
Attack Vector 
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. The Base Score increases the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component. 
Network 
The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed 'remotely exploitable' and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers). 
Attack Complexity 
This metric describes the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. Such conditions may require the collection of more information about the target or computational exceptions. The assessment of this metric excludes any requirements for user interaction in order to exploit the vulnerability. If a specific configuration is required for an attack to succeed, the Base metrics should be scored assuming the vulnerable component is in that configuration. 
Low 
Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. 
.
 An attacker can expect repeatable success against the vulnerable component. 
Privileges Required 
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess before successfully exploiting the vulnerability. 
None 
The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files to carry out an attack. 
User Interaction 
This metric captures the requirement for a user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise the vulnerable component. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner. 
Required 
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. 
Scope 
Does a successful attack impact a component other than the vulnerable component? If so, the Base Score increases and the Confidentiality, Integrity and Authentication metrics should be scored relative to the impacted component. 
Unchanged 
An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority. 
Confidentiality 
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones. 
High 
There is total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. 
Integrity 
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. 
High 
There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component. 
Availability 
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. 
.
 It refers to the loss of availability of the impacted component itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of an impacted component. 
High 
There is total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable). 
 
 
Temporal score metrics 
(3) 
Exploit Code Maturity 
This metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked, and is typically based on the current state of exploit techniques, exploit code availability, or active, 'in-the-wild' exploitation. 
Unproven 
No exploit code is available, or an exploit is theoretical. 
Remediation Level 
The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final. 
Official Fix 
A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. 
Report Confidence 
This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. For example, an impact may be recognized as undesirable, but the root cause may not be known. The vulnerability may later be corroborated by research which suggests where the vulnerability may lie, though the research may not be certain. Finally, a vulnerability may be confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. 
.
 The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers. 
Confirmed 
Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this). Source code is available to independently verify the assertions of the research, or the author or vendor of the affected code has confirmed the presence of the vulnerability. 
Please see  
Common Vulnerability Scoring System 
 for more information on the definition of these metrics. 
The following table provides an  
exploitability assessment

Publicly disclosed 
Exploited 
Exploitability assessment 
No 
No 
Exploitation Less Likely 
According to the CVSS metric, the attack vector is network (AV:N) and the user interaction is required (UI:R). What is the target context of the remote code execution? 
This attack requires a client to connect to a malicious server, and that could allow the attacker to gain code execution on the client.

FAQ 
According to the CVSS metric, the attack vector is network (AV:N) and the user interaction is required (UI:R). What is the target context of the remote code execution? 
This attack requires a client to connect to a malicious server, and that could allow the attacker to gain code execution on the client.

Use the provided Microsoft Security Response Center post details below, generate a valid JSON object with a detailed and comprehensive summary. The summary should be less than 15 sentences long, explaining the nature of the vulnerability, how an attacker may exploit it, the underlying cause, and the availability of an official fix. The post is classified as one of ['Critical', 'New feature', 'Solution provided', 'Information only']. 
Use the post_type to guide your summary. If a post_type is 'Information only' it likely means Microsoft updated the FAQs but nothing substantive beyond the previous revision. So your summary is merely needs to state that the post is a updated revision and is information only. 

If a post_type is 'Solution provided' you must mention the remedy or workaround.
If a post_type is NaN, you can deduce the post_type by searching for 'Remediation Level' in the post body and whether it says 'Official Fix' or not.

Clearly identify the affected Microsoft product(s), services, and or features. Use your knowledge to add any related facts or comments for a better explanation. Do not restate the post title or use redundant metadata information. The metadata provided includes id, post_id, title, post_type, and published date.

Example summary:
Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) is affected by a use after free vulnerability in Profiles, identified as CVE-2023-5472. This vulnerability was assigned by Chrome and is addressed by ingesting Chromium. The latest version of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) is no longer vulnerable. The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the Chromium Open Source Software (OSS) consumed by Microsoft Edge. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Microsoft has provided a solution by releasing a security update for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) with the build number 118.0.2088.76. System administrators are advised to update their Microsoft Edge installations to the latest version to mitigate the risk of exploitation. For more information, refer to the [Google Chrome Releases](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023) page.

Generate a valid JSON object following this schema. DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER KEYS.

    ""metadata"": {
        ""id"": ""b2cced8d-a552-f52a-6699-1da6b97d015d"",

        ""revision: ""1.4"",
        ""published"": ""<dd-mm-YYYY>""
    },
    ""summary"": ""INSERT SUMMARY HERE""
}

Notes for LLM:
- Ensure the summary is robust, technically thorough, and less than 15 sentences.
- Target audience is Microsoft system engineers and administrators - experts. Generate a summary that is informative and valuable for them. Basic information like how to find the browser version number is not useful.
- Focus on the key aspects of the vulnerability and its impact on the specific Microsoft:
    - which product(s) are affected
    - is a service affected? If so, which one?
    - is a specific feature affected?
    - what is the attack vector?
    - is there an official fix? If not, is there a temporary workaround?
- make sure you scan all sections looking for explicit workarounds, mitigations or powershell commands. These are the most valuable pieces of information for system administrators.
- Include relevant details from your training data to enhance the summary.
- Avoid redundancy with provided metadata. Do not re-state the title or post_type in your summary. The reader already has this information.
- Do not include FAQ information in your summary unless it specifically mentions additional technical details or links for further research.
What not to include in the summary guidelines:
- DO NOT generate any text like 'Microsoft acknowledges the efforts of ...'
- DO NOT generate any text like 'Users can check their browser version by clicking on the three dots (...) ...'.
- DO NOT include any special thanks or acknowledgements. Just report on actionable facts.
- The JSON object should be correctly formatted and include all required fields in the schema. Do not add any additional fields.
- Do not output any text outside of the json object because an external script will parse the output.

Use the provided Microsoft Security Response Center post details below, generate a valid JSON object with a detailed and comprehensive summary. The summary should be less than 15 sentences long, explaining the nature of the vulnerability, how an attacker may exploit it, the underlying cause, and the availability of an official fix. The post is classified as one of ['Critical', 'New feature', 'Solution provided', 'Information only']. 
Use the post_type to guide your summary. If a post_type is 'Information only' it likely means Microsoft updated the FAQs but nothing substantive beyond the previous revision. So your summary is merely needs to state that the post is a updated revision and is information only. 

If a post_type is 'Solution provided' you must mention the remedy or workaround.
If a post_type is NaN, you can deduce the post_type by searching for 'Remediation Level' in the post body and whether it says 'Official Fix' or not.

Clearly identify the affected Microsoft product(s), services, and or features. Use your knowledge to add any related facts or comments for a better explanation. Do not restate the post title or use redundant metadata information. The metadata provided includes id, post_id, title, post_type, and published date.

Example summary:
Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) is affected by a use after free vulnerability in Profiles, identified as CVE-2023-5472. This vulnerability was assigned by Chrome and is addressed by ingesting Chromium. The latest version of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) is no longer vulnerable. The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the Chromium Open Source Software (OSS) consumed by Microsoft Edge. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Microsoft has provided a solution by releasing a security update for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) with the build number 118.0.2088.76. System administrators are advised to update their Microsoft Edge installations to the latest version to mitigate the risk of exploitation. For more information, refer to the [Google Chrome Releases](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023) page.

Generate a valid JSON object following this schema. DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER KEYS.

Notes for LLM:
- Ensure the summary is robust, technically thorough, and less than 15 sentences.
- Target audience is Microsoft system engineers and administrators - experts. Generate a summary that is informative and valuable for them. Basic information like how to find the browser version number is not useful.
- Focus on the key aspects of the vulnerability and its impact on the specific Microsoft:
    - which product(s) are affected
    - is a service affected? If so, which one?
    - is a specific feature affected?
    - what is the attack vector?
    - is there an official fix? If not, is there a temporary workaround?
- make sure you scan all sections looking for explicit workarounds, mitigations or powershell commands. These are the most valuable pieces of information for system administrators.
- Include relevant details from your training data to enhance the summary.
- Avoid redundancy with provided metadata. Do not re-state the title or post_type in your summary. The reader already has this information.
- Do not include FAQ information in your summary unless it specifically mentions additional technical details or links for further research.
What not to include in the summary guidelines:
- DO NOT generate any text like 'Microsoft acknowledges the efforts of ...'
- DO NOT generate any text like 'Users can check their browser version by clicking on the three dots (...) ...'.
- DO NOT include any special thanks or acknowledgements. Just report on actionable facts.
- The JSON object should be correctly formatted and include all required fields in the schema. Do not add any additional fields.
- Do not output any text outside of the json object because an external script will parse the output.
