Objective: Your task is to evaluate the text extracted from a post by the Microsoft Security Response Center and classify it according to the provided guidelines. Your output must be a valid JSON object, containing no text outside the JSON structure. The JSON object will be consumed by another process; extraneous text outside of the JSON structure will cause the process to crash.

Classification Guidelines:

1. Classification Categories:
   - Critical:
     - If there is no Official Fix mentioned in the Remediation Level section, classify the post as 'Critical'.
     - If the text of the post contains any reference to "operating in the wild" or "being actively exploited", classify the post as 'Critical'.
   - Solution Provided:
     - If the revision is "1.0" or "1.0000000000" and there is an Official Fix available, classify the post as 'Solution provided'.
   - Information Only:
     - If the revision/version number is greater than '1.0', classify the post as 'Information only' unless there are significant updates indicating an official fix or new threat information.

2. Decision Hierarchy:
   - Evaluate the post for any references to "operating in the wild" or "being actively exploited" first.
   - Next, check for the presence of an Official Fix in the Remediation Level section.
   - Finally, consider the revision number and evaluate the post description in the Metadata section.
   - Multiple signals must be considered before making a final classification.

3. Specific Instructions:
   - Proceed step-by-step to classify the post based on the text below.
   - Ensure that the JSON object follows the specified schema and is valid.
   - Do not output any dialog or text outside of the JSON object. Extraneous text will cause the ingestion script to fail.

Generate a valid JSON object following this schema:
{
    "metadata": {
        "id": "b2cced8d-a552-f52a-6699-1da6b97d015d",
        "post_id": "CVE-2018-10001",
        "revision: "1.4",
        "published": "<dd-mm-YYYY>"
    },
    "classification": "Solution provided"
}

""",
    "patch_management": """
Your goal is to differentiate between conversational emails and those emails that provide valuable technical content and to then classify those emails. Note. Many emails are very short because they only contain conversational dialog between the original poster and a responder, however, short emails can also contain links to information or tools. Ignore email signatures and any text that is not part of the email body.

Primary Goal:
Classify each email into one of the following categories and format the output as a valid JSON object. Valid classifications are ["Helpful tool", "Conversational", "Problem statement", "Solution provided"].

Classification Criteria:

'Helpful tool': Short emails often linking to resources or mentioning Microsoft ecosystem tools without solving a specific problem. Use the number of unique tokens as a guide; fewer tokens suggest this category. Examples include posts linking to tech community blogs or Oracle security alerts.

'Conversational': emails discussing personal views, environment configurations, or incomplete technical details. These are dialogues lacking a clear problem or solution. Examples include discussions on SCCM patching for non-domain assets or issues noticed after updates.

'Problem statement': emails describing specific issues with technologies, products, services, or patches. These capture symptoms and challenges faced. Examples include discussions on bootloader patch issues or BitLocker configuration service errors.

'Solution provided': emails providing explanations or links to resources solving specific problems. These may not always describe the problem but offer a clear solution. Examples include emails linking to fixes for Azure Stack issues or addressing specific CVE vulnerabilities.

Use of Metadata in Analysis:
Included in the context are 3 features you can use to help in your analysis:
- the number of unique tokens as computed by the Spacy package
- Rake-generated keywords (highest scoring)
- noun chunks (most informative)
Utilize these features to supplement your analysis regarding the intent and subject of each email.

Handling Ambiguities:
Consider the length and context of emails to determine the appropriate category. When the text is limited, lean towards 'Conversational'. If a problem or solution is clearly defined, classify accordingly. When a link to a tool or blog is included, consider it a 'Helpful tool'.

6. JSON Object Schema for Output:
{
    "metadata": {
        "id": "<post_id>",
        "subject": "<subject>",
        "receivedDateTime": "<ISO 8601>"
    },
    "classification": "<classification>"
}

7. Contextual Understanding:
    Focus on the content and nature of each email. Classify as 'Solution provided' only if it contains explicit solution details. Emails that are acknowledgments or follow-ups without specific solution details should be classified as 'Conversational'.
