Use the provided Microsoft Security Response Center post details below, generate a valid JSON object with a detailed and comprehensive summary. The summary should be less than 15 sentences long, explaining the nature of the vulnerability, how an attacker may exploit it, the underlying cause, and the availability of an official fix. The post is classified as one of ['Critical', 'New feature', 'Solution provided', 'Information only']. 
Use the post_type to guide your summary. If a post_type is 'Information only' it likely means Microsoft updated the FAQs but nothing substantive beyond the previous revision. So your summary can be brief - retsate the key concepts and scores. However, you still must evaluate the provided revision value and state what the actual revision value is. Chromium and Microsoft Edge posts at revision 1.0 can also be 'Information only' because the source of the solution is outside of Microsoft's control.

If a post_type is 'Solution provided' you must mention the remedy or workaround and make it clear to the reader how to take action.
If a post_type is not available, you can deduce the post_type by searching for 'Remediation Level' in the post body and whether it says 'Official Fix' or not.

Clearly identify the affected Microsoft product(s), services, and or features. Use your knowledge to add any related facts or comments for a better explanation. Do not restate the post title or use redundant metadata information. The metadata provided includes id, post_id, title, post_type, and published date.

Example summary below, Do not copy verbatim. Generate unique summaries for each post based on the context provided. The following is a zero-shot example only. You must generate a complete, concise and accurate summary for each post.

Example summary:
Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) is affected by a use after free vulnerability in Profiles, identified as CVE-2023-5472. This vulnerability was assigned by Chrome and is addressed by ingesting Chromium. The latest version of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) is no longer vulnerable. The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the Chromium Open Source Software (OSS) consumed by Microsoft Edge. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Microsoft has provided a solution by releasing a security update for Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) with the build number 118.0.2088.76. System administrators are advised to update their Microsoft Edge installations to the latest version to mitigate the risk of exploitation. For more information, refer to the [Google Chrome Releases](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023) page.

Generate a valid JSON object following this schema. DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER KEYS.

}

Notes for LLM:
- Ensure the summary is robust, technically thorough, and less than 15 sentences.
- Target audience is Microsoft system engineers and administrators - experts. Generate a summary that is informative and valuable for them. Basic information like how to find the browser version number is not useful.
- Focus on the key aspects of the vulnerability and its impact on the specific Microsoft:
    - which product(s) are affected
    - is a service affected? If so, which one?
    - is a specific feature affected?
    - what is the attack vector?
    - is there an official fix? If not, is there a temporary workaround?
- make sure you scan all sections looking for explicit workarounds, mitigations or powershell commands. These are the most valuable pieces of information for system administrators.
- Include relevant details from your training data to enhance the summary.
- Avoid redundancy with provided metadata. Do not re-state the title or post_type in your summary. The reader already has this information.
- Do not include FAQ information in your summary unless it specifically mentions additional technical details or links for further research.
What not to include in the summary guidelines:
- DO NOT generate any text like 'Microsoft acknowledges the efforts of ...'
- DO NOT generate any text like 'Users can check their browser version by clicking on the three dots (...) ...'.
- DO NOT include any special thanks or acknowledgements. Just report on actionable facts.
- The JSON object should be correctly formatted and include all required fields in the schema. Do not add any additional fields.
- Do not output any text outside of the json object because an external script will parse the output.

You are a Microsoft System administrator with expertise in both on-premises and azure cloud, Intune, and virtualization technologies.
Below are details from recent post from the public Google Group 'Patch Management' where other microsoft system administrators discuss the how-to's and why's of security patch management across a broad spectrum of Operating Systems, Applications, and Network Devices. This list is meant as an aid to network and systems administrators and security professionals who are responsible for maintaining the security posture of their hosts and applications.
The posts are email threads sorted by subject and receivedDateTime so multiple posts will share the same 'subject' and 'topic'
Many of the posts contain very text and very little useful information and an email signature in the footer.
You have four goals to accomplish in a step by step manner: 1, classify each post (criteria given the below), 2, generate a concise and grammatically correct evaluation/summary of each message, 3, look for posts that contain actionable solutions to patching issues and give extra attention to these posts,  4, output your entire answer in markdown. your classification goes under the 'classification' heading and the remainder of your response goes under the 'summary' heading.

---------------------
{context_str}
---------------------
Classify a post as 'Helpful tool' if it discusses a useful product, tool, or technology that is terrtiary/not directly related to the subject but may be useful for other administrators to try.
"Classify a post as 'Conversational' if it is has less than 50 unique tokens (available in the metadata) and is dialog between users without a description of a tool or problem or solution. Do not generate your own answer for conversational messages, simply output the email message as-is. without any further analysis.
Classify a post as 'Problem statement' if it includes a description of a problem without a solution.
Classify a post as 'Solution provided' if it includes a detailed description of a solution to a particular patching issue."Use the metadata fields 'evaluated_keywords' and 'evaluated_noun_chunks' to help your analysis.
Given the above information, classify the post as one of the following categories, no other categories are allowed: 
You must output your classification in markdown with the format '##### Classification:\n
'{{classification}}'
For 'Conversational' posts, do not answer with any of your own analysis, instead simply restate the first 30 tokens available from the post text.
For the other post types, generate a thorough and accurate description from post. Be concise and accurate. If there is a problem statement, evaluate it in a step by step manner and describe the problem with proper grammar and terminology (you may edit the original text to improve readability). Use numbered and bulleted lists to itemize key steps or points.
For posts that you classify as 'Solution provided', explain what the solution is in a well formatted and technically accurate manner that system administrators understand. You may fill in gaps in the authors text if it helps improve the quality of the answer. Evaluate the solution in a step by step manner and describe the solution with proper grammar and terminology. Use numbered and bulleted lists to itemize key steps or points. Limit your answer to 10 sentences.
"You must output your final response in markdown with the format '#### Summary:
{{summary}}
Your entire answer must be contained in the summary section.
Do not include or discuss the metadata 'subject' or the metadata 'receivedDateTime', or the metadata 'id' in your answer
Do not restate your instructions in your answer. You may add your own knowledge of the matter if it helps clarify a problem or solution contained in a post
Given the above instructions and context information, evaluate and describe the email message with the following data: subject, receivedDateTime, doc id, first 25 words: {query_str}
